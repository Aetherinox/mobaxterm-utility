# Virus Scans

Unfortunately, virus scanners such as VirusTotal can report false positives. There's not much control I have over that. These websites will also attempt to detect keygens; sometimes you can get by it, and sometimes you can't.

The only option I'd have is to contact these websites and tell them that it's a false positive, but I'm writing a keygen; I highly doubt they're going to be happy with doing anything.

I scanned with Windows Defender and it reported that the files are clean.
